Welcome aboard. Orginization will be done soon.

I made a GitHub repo for all my piracy links, because bookmarks get annoying after a while.

Links with a ⭐ are recommended by me as I think they have the best content. It's all personal opinion.

If you are new to piracy, I recommend the [Beginners Guide to Piracy](https://rentry.org/Piracy-BG).
