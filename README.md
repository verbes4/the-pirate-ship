Welcome aboard. Orginization will be done soon.

I made a GitHub repo for all my piracy links, because bookmarks get annoying after a while.

Links with a ⭐ are recommended by me as I think they have the best content. It's all personal opinion.

This list is also mirrored on [my website](https://verbes4.xyz/the-pirate-ship.md).
